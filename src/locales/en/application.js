  APPLICATIONS_DESC:
    'An application provides users with comprehensive business functions in one package. App templates in KubeSphere are built on the Helm packaging specification. They are delivered through a unified public or private Helm repository. An application is composed of one or more Kubernetes objects including workloads, services and ingress.',
  APP_DEPLOYMENT_DESC:
    'Lightweight, portable and self-contained software packaging technology enables applications to run in almost any place in the same way.',

  LB_ALG_DESC:
    'Support standard load balancing algorithms</br>ROUND_ROBIN：Polling, the default load balancing algorithm.</br>LEAST_CONN：Randomly select two healthy hosts, and then select one host with fewer links from the selected two hosts.</br>RANDOM：Pick one randomly from all healthy hosts.',

  LB_LEAST_CONN: 'LEAST_CONN',
  LB_RANDOM: 'RANDOM',

  CLUSTER_NAME_DESC:
    'It can only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens("-"), and must begin with a lowercase letter, ending with a number or lowercase letter. The maximum length of characters is set to 14.',

  CLUSTER_ALIAS_DESC:
    'Alias can be composed of any character to help you better distinguish resources and support Chinese names.',

  COMPONENT_VERSION_DESC:
    'For the application of governance to distinguish between components. It can only contain lowercase letters and numbers. The maximum length of characters is set to 16.',

  SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT: 'Stateless service(Deployment)',
  SERVICE_STATEFULSET: 'Stateful service(StatefulSet)',

  CONNECTION_POOL_TIP:
    'Create a fixed number of connection objects for the application, save them in the pool for reuse. The existing pool is available for each access, and is returned to the pool after use.',

  APP_GOVERNANCE_DESC:
    'If Application Governance is enabled, the Istio-proxy container will be injected as a SideCar in each component. <a href="https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/" target="_blank">READ MORE</a>',

  POD_ISOLATION_RATIO_DESC:
    'Maximum % of Pod for the upstream service that can be ejected. It uses up rounding, when set to 13% it will isolate up to 2 instances if 10 instances exist.',
  BASE_EJECTION_TIME_DESC:
    'Minimum ejection duration. A host will remain ejected for a period equal to the product of minimum ejection duration and the number of times the host has been ejected.',
  CIRCUIT_DESC:
    'The circuit breaking is a microservice connection protection mechanism that addresses the avalanche effect. When a microservice of the fan-out connection is unavailable or the response time is too long, the service will be downgraded, and the call of the microservice of the node will be broken, and the error response is quickly returned. After detectin the microservice response is normal, the connection will be resumed. ',
